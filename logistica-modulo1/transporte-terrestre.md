# TOPIC 4 - CONCEPTS AND STRUCTURES: GROUND TRANSPORTATION

## 4.1 - PASSENGER VEHICLES

Football delegations often use ground transportation to move around cities, which makes it easier for everyone to stay together. Although there are different types of vehicles, buses are the most used in football due to their passenger capacity. The Logistics Director must be familiar with these types of vehicles to optimize transportation operations and meet the delegation's demands.

### **BUSES**

- **DD BUS:** DD is the acronym for double-decker buses, meaning those with two levels of seating.
- **LD BUS:** LD stands for low driver buses, where the driver’s cabin is on the lower level while passenger seats are on the upper level. The luggage compartments in this type of vehicle are usually very spacious.
- **TOCO BUS:** Also known as “semi-heavy” or “4x2,” it has two axles and four wheels in contact with the ground.
- **TRUCKED BUS:** Also known as “truck,” “heavy,” or “6x2,” these have three axles and six wheels in contact with the ground. The additional axle provides more stability and comfort.

### **CARS**

- **HATCH:** Small/medium-sized with a “built-in” trunk.
- **SEDAN:** Usually larger, with an integrated trunk designed at the rear.
- **SUV:** Stands for *Sport Utility Vehicle*.
- **PICKUP:** Also known as *trucks*, they typically have open cargo beds.
- **MINIVAN:** Vehicles with more than 5 seats.

## 4.2 - SEAT CATEGORIES

Considering that buses are one of the main types of vehicles, understanding the seat differences is important so that the Club and National Team Logistics Director can choose the one that best suits the delegation.

### **CONVENTIONAL BUS**  
This is the most economical and basic type of bus offered by companies. It is most suitable for short trips, as it does not offer extra services and usually has standard cushioned seats with limited recline.  

This category has around 42 seats and can accommodate passengers exactly, but without extra space. Some buses also have air conditioning and bathrooms.

### **EXECUTIVE BUS**  
This type of bus has fewer seats, allowing for much more sitting and legroom.  

In addition to air conditioning, some companies offer extra services such as onboard water.  

Comfort is the main difference between executive and conventional buses. Some companies offer services in executive buses such as a minibar with mineral water, television, and radio, as well as air conditioning and a bathroom.  

It is ideal for medium-duration trips (around 5 hours).

### **SEMI-RECLINER BUS**  
Designed for longer trips, the semi-recliner bus offers passengers more comfort and tranquility.  

In this type of bus, the seats recline more and are therefore more comfortable. Additionally, some have TVs, fridges, footrests, and onboard service.  

For extended trips, this is an excellent option as it allows for greater rest. Some companies offer blankets and sanitized pillows. Coffee and headphones for watching TV or listening to music may also be provided.

### **RECLINER BUS**  
If you’re looking for absolute comfort on a several-hour journey, the recliner bus is the best option.  

The number of passengers in this type of bus usually does not exceed 28, and the seats come with footrests.  

It offers extras like double anatomical seats that convert into real beds, along with a blanket, pillow, and fridge.  

If you want more comfort and can afford a more expensive ticket, choose the recliner bus. It usually accommodates a maximum of 28 passengers.  

Its distinctive features include:  
- Climate-controlled environment  
- TV, DVD, radio  
- Fridge  
- 180º reclining seats (bed type)  
- Headrests and blankets  
- In some cases, small snacks  

This type of bus is ideal for long and tiring trips, as it allows passengers to sleep deeply in wide and comfortable seats.

## 4.3 - CARGO VEHICLES

Delegations often travel with a large amount of luggage and material for sports practices. For internal transport, there are different types of vehicles depending on the size and weight transported.

- **SMALL TRUCK:** Ideal for urban areas. Its maximum dimensions are 2.2 m wide and 6.3 m long, with a capacity to transport up to 3 tons.
- **TOCO TRUCK (SEMI-HEAVY):** Like the buses, it has 4 wheels in contact with the ground, divided into two axles. It can transport up to 6 tons, with a maximum length of 14 m and a weight of up to 16 tons. It is used for moving and general cargo transport.
- **TRUCK TRUCK:** Similar to the trucked bus, it has 3 axles and 6 wheels in contact with the ground. It has the same dimensions as the toco truck but can transport heavier loads (from 10 to 14 tons), and its gross weight can reach 23 tons.
- **BITRUCK:** Also known as “8x2” or “8x4,” they have four axles and 8 wheels in contact with the ground, with greater transport capacity and can reach a gross weight of 29 tons. These are the trucks that carry grain and very heavy loads.
- **VAN:** A vehicle with a body that can be used to transport passengers or cargo in the same compartment. It has 4 wheels and various dimensions. Unlike a passenger car, it can transport more than 6 passengers.

## 4.4 - DOCUMENTS

As with lodging and air transport operations, ground transportation also requires a series of documents for the transportation of passengers and cargo.

- **PASSENGER LIST:** It is important that bus transportation always registers the passenger list with the responsible authorities. This allows travel control and ensures insurance in case of an incident.
- **TRAVEL INSURANCE:** In addition to the mandatory insurance from bus companies, optional travel insurance is another guarantee of protection and safety for passengers.
