# TOPIC 2 - CONCEPTS AND STRUCTURES: ACCOMMODATION

## 2.1 - TYPES OF ACCOMMODATION

"Type of accommodation" refers to a commercial establishment that receives tourists of various profiles: leisure, corporate, temporary residence, etc.

The Logistics Manager must be familiar with the different types of accommodation to make informed decisions about where to host the football delegation, evaluating service levels and negotiating better conditions.

The four main types used by football delegations are:

- **HOTEL:** A commercial establishment offering rooms with various configurations and services such as reception, room service, breakfast, among others. Its level varies according to category.
- **INN:** Similar to a hotel, but with a horizontal layout and possibly subdivided into chalets or bungalows.
- **RESORT:** In addition to hotel services, it includes leisure and entertainment infrastructure such as a spa, recreational activities, and themed restaurants.
- **HOSTEL:** Accommodation in shared rooms with lower rates.

This course will focus on the use of hotels, as they are the main type used by football delegations.

## 2.2 - HOTEL CATEGORIES

Hotel stars indicate their level of service. Each country has its own evaluation system. In Brazil, **SBClass** (Brazilian Accommodation System) is used, which requires 100% compliance with mandatory requirements for each star.

Mandatory requirements include aspects such as room quality, services offered, guest care, and hygiene and safety conditions.

## 2.3 - SCHEDULES AND SERVICES

Hotels may offer different **meal plans** depending on their structure and customer type:
