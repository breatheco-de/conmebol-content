# TOPIC 3 - CONCEPTS AND STRUCTURES: AIR TRANSPORT

## 3.1 - TYPES OF FLIGHT

Aviation offers different services, types, and forms of flight for passengers. Each flight has its own unique complexity and characteristics, as well as its own definition. The Logistics Director of a club or national team must understand these differences, as they directly impact the travel operations of the delegation.

**FLIGHT SERVICE**

- **COMMERCIAL FLIGHT** is the part of civil aviation that consists of operating an aircraft to transport passengers and cargo.
- **CARGO FLIGHT:** also known as charter, is the service of chartering an aircraft. With a schedule and routes defined according to demand, it allows autonomy and agility on certain routes. Since it is not a regular flight, tickets cannot be purchased. It involves renting a plane for transport. A charter flight is different from an air taxi, which uses small aircraft.

**TYPE OF FLIGHT**

- **DIRECT FLIGHT:** a flight with no stops along the way, meaning the passenger arrives at the destination as soon as they leave the point of origin.
- **STOP FLIGHT:** has a layover, but the passenger does not need to disembark. It is commonly used for refueling or boarding new passengers.
- **CONNECTING FLIGHT:** in this case, the passenger must disembark at an airport halfway through the journey to change planes and continue to the destination.

**FORM OF FLIGHT**

- **DOMESTIC FLIGHT:** flights where both the origin and destination airports are in the same country.
- **INTERNATIONAL FLIGHT:** flights where the country of the origin airport is different from the country of the destination airport. The procedures for this type of flight differ, as passengers must go through migration procedures in the country of origin and immigration and customs in the destination country, except when countries are part of an international agreement area.

## 3.2 - SEAT CATEGORIES

When boarding a large aircraft, passengers notice different types of seats: some bigger, some smaller, some with more space, some with less, some with in-flight meals, others without any service. This is because airplanes can have various seat configurations and, of course, different prices. Knowing the seat categories on the plane is important so that the Logistics Manager can distribute the delegation in the most convenient way, understanding both the structural limitations of the aircraft and the financial limitations of the organization they work for.

- **ECONOMY CLASS:** this is the lowest-cost seating class on a plane. Depending on the aircraft and airline, passengers may have reclining seats and catering services (paid or not), the ability to reserve a seat, onboard entertainment, etc.
- **BUSINESS CLASS:** also known as executive class, usually offers more comfort than economy class, providing more space and more comfortable seating. This class also offers different catering services and more entertainment options during the flight. Purchasing a ticket in this class also grants passengers higher baggage allowances and overweight limits.
- **FIRST CLASS:** is the top-tier category on a flight, offering more privacy and a different level of service. Not all planes have this class, but those that do offer extremely comfortable seating and sophisticated onboard services, with flexible schedules for passengers to choose from. In addition to the comforts of the two other classes (business and economy), airlines also provide special treatment at the airport, including VIP lounges and dedicated service.

## 3.3 - IN-FLIGHT SERVICE

All attention given by the crew to passengers on the plane is considered in-flight service provided by the airline. In addition to the food served to passengers, it includes the manner of treatment, instructions on emergency exits and evacuation, requests for available items, and general and specific guidelines.

- **FLIGHT ATTENDANT** is the airline professional who welcomes passengers onto the plane, provides all safety instructions, and offers available services during the flight.
- **IN-FLIGHT ENTERTAINMENT:** airlines may or may not provide entertainment such as TVs, internet, etc., especially on long-haul flights.
- **CATERING:** this is the food service offered inside the aircraft. For safety reasons, there are many rules for preparing, storing, and serving food on the plane. Trolleys store trays with cold snacks, while inserts are containers that keep meals hot until placed into onboard ovens. On short trips, only quick snacks are usually offered, whereas longer international flights provide more complete meals.

## 3.4 - LUGGAGE

From an aviation perspective, there are three different types of luggage: checked baggage, carry-on baggage, and personal items. Airfare usually identifies what kind of baggage the passenger is entitled to, as well as the weight and size limitations. Soccer delegations often travel with a large amount of luggage, including sports equipment and everything necessary for training and matches. The Logistics Manager is responsible for knowing all the procedures related to the luggage being transported to avoid extra costs due to excess volume or weight.

- **LARGE SUITCASES** are checked in before boarding and returned to the passenger at the destination. They are tagged for identification. On connecting flights, there are differences between domestic and international flights. On domestic flights, baggage is collected at the final airport. On international flights, the passenger must retrieve the luggage at the first stop in the destination country and, if necessary, check it in again for the domestic flight. It is important to note that baggage must comply with weight limits stipulated by the airline/control agencies. There is also a limit on the number of items. Not all fares include checked baggage, so it's essential to know what your ticket allows.
- **CARRY-ON BAGGAGE:** is the small suitcase with specific size and weight limits allowed by the airline and airport authorities. If these limits are not respected, the passenger will be required to check the bag and may incur unexpected charges. Since it travels with the passenger, it is also scanned by X-ray before entering the boarding area. ANAC (Brazilian agency) regulations allow maximum dimensions of 35 x 25 x 55 cm (length x width x height), including handles, pockets, and wheels, and a maximum weight of 10 kg.
- **PERSONAL ITEM:** some airlines designate a backpack/handbag/purse as a personal item that can be brought in addition to the carry-on baggage and must fit under the seat in front of the passenger.
- **BALANCING:** balancing is an aviation safety procedure that considers the aircraft’s weight distribution, producing a more stable flight without the risk of rotation along any axis.

## 3.5 - TYPES OF AIRCRAFT

We currently have many different aircraft in terms of size, configuration, and purpose. However, it's possible to understand the four main groups of aircraft types in order to grasp the key differences between them.

- **TURBOPROP PLANES:** These are aircraft that use combustion engines to turn the propeller and create the thrust needed to move the plane. They have lower speed, cargo capacity, and range than jets but are more economical options.
- **This type of aircraft** uses turbines to generate the thrust needed to move the plane. Thrust is greater than that of turboprops, making them faster. The complexity of the different types of jets also allows them to carry more passengers and cargo and travel long distances.
- **EXECUTIVE JETS** are aircraft of different sizes used for private purposes and can have various configurations.
- **HELICOPTERS:** These aircraft stay aloft using blades that function as rotating wings to propel the vehicle. They are easy to maneuver, take off and land vertically, and can hover in place.

## 3.6 - AIRPORT

An airport is much more than a place where passengers and cargo board and disembark for various global destinations. It is a tightly controlled environment with its own language, unique access structures, and codes that may seem unfamiliar, but are key to effective communication regardless of where you are flying. Here are some key terms and locations that a club or national team Logistics Director will inevitably encounter.

- **PHONETIC ALPHABET:** The phonetic alphabet created by NATO is the most widely used worldwide for spelling, as it uses English keyword equivalents for each letter to avoid confusion and misunderstandings in communication, whether in person, by radio, phone, etc. In Brazilian aviation, it’s informally known as the "Zulu alphabet."

- **IMMIGRATION:** can be identified as Passport Control, when the immigration officer checks the passenger’s documentation. This phase may also involve required forms to fill out. It represents international entry for non-natives or non-citizens in the destination country.

Ideally, passports should be valid for at least six months from the date of departure. Some countries also require an International Certificate of Vaccination, including yellow fever and more recently COVID vaccines, which must be administered at least 10 days before travel. Be aware of any connection countries that may require specific transit documentation. Immigration officials are interested in the traveler’s status, trip duration, and place of stay.

- **CUSTOMS:** these are the local authorities controlling the flow of goods. Immigration handles the entry of people; customs handles goods. Each country has a specific list of permitted items. Agents have the authority to inspect your baggage and are concerned with what you are carrying, subject to specific fees.
- **IATA CODE:** IATA stands for International Air Transport Association, representing airlines. They control over 80% of global air traffic. The IATA code is used to identify airports worldwide. It consists of three letters that refer to the location, region, or airport name. It is used on baggage tags, boarding passes, etc.
- **SLOT:** a term used in aviation to determine the time slot an airline uses to land and take off. It’s like reserving a time frame within the airport's capacity. Only level 3 airports (with congestion and high air traffic) use slot allocation.

## 3.7 - DOCUMENTS

Just as we carry personal documents for everyday matters, certain documents are essential in airports for passengers to fly, enter a country, check in bags, etc.

It is the consolidated information about the ticket reservation, such as passenger details, locator, value, documentation. This document is used to check in and access the boarding pass.

- **BOARDING PASS:** this document allows the passenger to access the boarding gate and the aircraft. It contains information about the flight, gate number, schedules, dates, etc.
- **PASSPORT:** this is the passenger’s official document for leaving one country and entering another. The passport contains personal data as well as records of entries and exits from countries, visas, authorizations, etc.
- **ID CARD:** Registro Geral (RG) or Documento Nacional de Identificação (National Identification Document) is the passenger’s country of origin document that contains standardized identification data.
- **VACCINATION CARDS:** this personal document shows which vaccines the passenger has received. In some countries, entry is subject to specific vaccines (such as COVID or yellow fever). The vaccination card serves as proof of these requirements.
- **TRAVEL INSURANCE:** a service the passenger can purchase when traveling (mandatory in some countries) that provides compensation in case of an accident or baggage incident, for example.

Travel Assistance is a type of insurance where the insurer pays in advance, with no need for reimbursement. It includes specifications for the places where assistance is available.

**VISAS:** a visa is an authorization to enter a particular country. The document usually indicates the visa's validity and the activities the person may carry out. Each country has its own visa rules, and some do not require this authorization at all. For countries that do require it, engaging in unauthorized activities is considered illegal and can lead to deportation. There are various visa types, such as tourist, student, residency, temporary stay, temporary work, business, investor, etc.
