# TOPIC 1 – INTRODUCTION

## 1.1 – LOGISTICS: THEORETICAL CONCEPTS

Hello students! First of all, welcome to the course **"LOGISTICS MANAGEMENT APPLIED TO FOOTBALL CLUBS AND NATIONAL TEAMS"** from the CONMEBOL Evolution Program. We believe your interest in this field is strong, and we hope you take full advantage of the course content to develop yourself within this important football industry.

The course is designed for both those already working in the field who want to reflect on various topics, and for students interested in working as logistics managers in football. Our aim is to cover both theoretical and practical content to train and prepare students for this dynamic job market.

Although the word "LOGISTICS" has gained popularity in modern times with the rise of *delivery* services and e-commerce, it’s a term that has been used for centuries in society.

In 481 B.C., Persians and Greeks applied this concept when organizing army movements and supply chains. Military officers in charge of provisioning during battles were called "logistics officers." In Latin, “logisticus” comes from the Greek “logistikos,” meaning calculation and reasoning in a mathematical sense.

Another theory traces the term to the French verb “loger,” which refers to housing or providing lodging. The noble Baron Antoine Henri, a war scholar and collaborator of Napoleon Bonaparte, wrote a book in 1836 titled *Summary of the Art of War*, where he defined logistics as “the action that leads to the preparation and support of campaigns; the art of moving armies.”

Although its origin is strongly linked to the military field, the evolution of various industries has broadened the concept of logistics, making it increasingly relevant in today’s globalized world. While it’s still associated with transportation and distribution of goods, it is now also linked to strategic and budgetary planning, as well as meeting end-user expectations.

The *Council of Logistics Management* (1996) defined logistics as: “the process of planning, implementing, and controlling the efficient flow and storage of goods, services, and related information from the point of origin to the point of consumption, in order to meet customer requirements.”

Similarly, Novaes (2001) defined logistics as “the process of efficiently planning, implementing, and controlling the flow and storage of products, as well as the associated services and information, from the point of origin to the point of consumption, aiming to fulfill customer requirements.”

According to this concept, logistics encompasses the entire process from production to the final delivery of a product to the consumer. Sports logistics shares this goal but has specific characteristics.

To better understand this point, we’ll divide the concept of Sports Logistics into three categories, using the organization of a football match as a reference:

- **Sports Logistics of those organizing the game** → **EVENT ORGANIZATION**
- **Sports Logistics of those operating the game** → **OPERATIONAL STRUCTURE**
- **Sports Logistics of those participating in the game** → **CLUBS AND NATIONAL TEAMS**

### **LOGISTICS OF THE ORGANIZATION**
This involves the Administrative Management of the Event, such as the planning carried out by Sports Confederations and Federations. The main focus is on the event’s regulations and standards, including:

- Administrative, technical, and disciplinary provisions  
- Participation criteria and competition systems  
- Playing conditions for athletes and referees  

### **LOGISTICS OF THE SPORTS STRUCTURE**
This relates to the Operational Management of the Event, including stadiums and sports arenas. The main focus is on infrastructure and its particularities, such as:

- Access, tickets, and accreditations  
- Match protocols and reports  
- Commercial areas, sponsorship, and marketing  

### **LOGISTICS OF THE PARTICIPANTS**
This focuses on the management of clubs and national teams participating in the event. The priority here is to address the specific needs of sports delegations.

Clubs and national teams must understand the event regulations, their rights, obligations, criteria, and sporting conditions. They must also be familiar with the event’s structure, including access, restrictions, and limitations.

## 1.2 – UNDERSTANDING THE COURSE

Our objective is to specifically analyze the Management of Logistics Applied to Football from the participants’ perspective—that is, **sports logistics for clubs and national teams**. Throughout the course, you’ll notice that many aspects are interconnected with other types of logistics, showing their importance in sports operations.

The course is divided into four modules:

### **MODULE 1: INTRODUCTION, CONCEPTS AND STRUCTURES**  
This module lays the foundation for the course, presenting key theoretical and structural concepts essential for the development of a Sports Logistics Manager. While some terms may be familiar, reinforcing their importance is crucial, as they will frequently appear throughout the course.

### **MODULE 2: REGULATIONS AND RELATIONSHIP WITH OTHER AREAS**  
Here, students will understand the sporting regulations and their impact on the logistics management of clubs and national teams. We will also explore the importance of the Logistics Manager’s relationship with other areas, such as the Technical and Administrative Departments, as well as external entities and local facilitators.

### **MODULE 3: GAME OPERATIONS**  
This module covers the planning and execution of game operations. We will analyze the importance of preliminary site visits for the Logistics Manager, coordination with event organizers, agreements, protocols, catering, and match development.

### **MODULE 4: TOOLS AND INNOVATION**  
In this module, we will reflect on how innovation has transformed logistics management in football. We will review various technological tools that optimize the work of the Logistics Manager, bringing agility and efficiency to daily operations.

The course **Logistics Management Applied to Football Clubs and National Teams** aims to contribute to the training of future managers in this key area. We hope that by the end of the course, students will be ready to take on professional responsibilities in sports logistics and fully understand the significance of their role in the success of competitions. Let’s get in the game!
