# TOPIC 5 – CONCEPTS AND STRUCTURES: OTHER TYPES OF TRANSPORTATION  

## 5.1 – WATER TRANSPORTATION  

Although it is less common in sports operations in general, in some situations we may encounter the need to deal with other types of transportation, such as water transport.  

### **MARITIME TRANSPORTATION**  
This is a type of water transportation that takes place in seas and oceans through vessels (ships, cargo ships, cruise ships, etc.), used for both passengers and goods.  

### **RIVER TRANSPORTATION**  
River transportation, considered one of the oldest known to humanity, is a type of water or waterway transport carried out through inland waterways.  

Before the invention of vessels (boats, rafts, ships, etc.), humans already used rivers as a means of transportation, making journeys on tree trunks.  

In Latin, the term “fluvial” comes from *fluvius* (river), associated with the verb *fluere*, which means to flow.  

Although water transportation is slower, it is widely used for moving goods and people, with lower operating costs compared to other means of transport.  

One of its main advantages is its large capacity, as it allows for the transport of large volumes of cargo.  

Additionally, it is a mode of transport with a lower environmental impact compared to other types, such as road or rail transport. However, it is limited by the need for navigable waterways.  

> "River transport is transportation carried out through rivers and artificial canals located within the interior of continents. It is part of the waterway transport system.  
> River transport means include vessels such as boats, launches, and canoes.  
> It is frequently used for the transportation of passengers and goods in specific regions and is fundamental for the connection between different transportation modes.  
> It can carry heavy and low-value-added cargo.  
> It has a lower environmental impact and its transportation costs are lower.  
> However, it is slower, so it is mainly recommended for short and medium distances.  
> In Brazil, especially in the northern region, waterways are used for transporting passengers between cities and for moving goods."  

> "River transport is a type of transport carried out through rivers and canals, whether natural or artificial. Therefore, it takes place within the interior of continents.  
> It is considered part of the waterway or aquatic transport system, characterized by the movement of people, animals, and goods through waterways."  

### **LAKE TRANSPORTATION**  
This is transportation carried out on lakes, lagoons, and inland bodies of water.  

## 5.2 – RAIL TRANSPORTATION  

> "Rail transportation is a type of movement that occurs through railway tracks and is used to transport, among other things, people and goods.  
> It is one of the oldest means of transportation, whose origin is directly related to the First Industrial Revolution, a historical event that took place in Europe at the end of the 18th and beginning of the 19th century."  

Rail transportation is carried out by vehicles that run on rails, such as trains.  

It is ideal for transporting heavy loads (minerals, agricultural products, steel, food) and for transporting passengers over medium and long distances.  

In Brazil, this means of transport has limited use compared to other countries.
